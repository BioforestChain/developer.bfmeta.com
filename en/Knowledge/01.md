# Consensus incentive mechanism



The consensus incentive mechanism is an incentive measure for miners who provide services such as computing power, network, storage, verification and packaging for the BFChain network, as well as an incentive measure for all address accounts that provide computing power, network and storage for participating in the BFChain voting governance.

Currently, the incentives for successfully forging a block in the BFChain consensus incentive mechanism can be divided into two components:

- Grant a certain amount of main chain equity
- Chain fees generated by all events in the current forged block

The objects that can get this incentive include:

- Forgers of the block, the incentive available is 40% of the total incentive of the block;
- All address accounts that vote for the forger in this round can get an incentive of 60% of the total incentive for the block.




## Total incentives for forging blocks

In the BFChain network, after each block is successfully forged, the bottom layer will calculate the total incentive that it should get. The formula is:

totalReward = rewardPerBlock + sum(eachtransactionfeeOftheBlock)

among them,

- rewardForPerBlock: It is the main chain equity incentive granted for forging this block. In the BFChain consensus, the amount of equity for this incentive will vary with the block height interval, as follows:

| Block height | Number of incentives(BFM) |
| :---------------: | :-----------------: |
|     0 - 3233      |          0          |
|   3234 - 246375   |         15          |
|  246376 - 492750  |         30          |
|  492751 - 739125  |         60          |
| 739126 - 27635044 |         90          |
|     27635045      |     55.61314071     |
|    27635045 -     |          0          |



- sum(eachtransactionfeeFortheBlock): where `eachtransactionfeeFortheBlock` is the on-chain fee of each event packaged into this block; `sum(eachtransactionfeeFortheBlock)` is the sum of the on-chain fee of each event packaged into this block.



The total incentive for forging a block will be shared by the block forger and all address accounts that vote for the forger in this round. The consensus rules for sharing are:

- Block forgers can get 40% of the total incentive for forging the block, that is, totalReward* 0.4
- **All address accounts** that voted for the forger in this round can get a total of 60% of the total incentive for forging the block, that is, totalReward* 0.6;
   - The incentive for each address account to vote for the forger is: totalReward * 0.6 * (The number of votes the address account has voted for the forger in the previous round / The forger's received in the previous round Total votes)
