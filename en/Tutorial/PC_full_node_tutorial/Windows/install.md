### Configure running password

#### Run password configuration


In order to ensure the safety of the user executing the command line tool, you can set a running password, and enter the password when executing each command to verify the user's identity.

The following will briefly introduce two ways to configure the running password. The second way will not leave a record in the command line, which is more secure. The second way is recommended.

1. Set the password directly in the command line
   
 Before starting the BCF node program formally, the user can add a key to the `PASSWORD` variable in the command line window and set the password required for command line access. Specific steps are as follows:
   
   1. Open a new Windows command line window;
   
   2. Enter the command in the command line window:


      ```
      set PASSWORD=123

      ```
   
   After the setting is successful, when the user executes any command in the BCF node program, the password will be required to proceed.

2. Set the password in the batch file
   
   1. Create a password setting file of `.bat`
      
      Copy the contents of the box below to the `.bat` file (change the password to your own password) and save the file:

      ```
      @echo off

      call set PASSWORD=123

      ```

   
   2. Execute `bat` batch file
      
      Execute the `.bat` file in `cmd` to complete the operation password setting.

      ```
      setPassword.bat
      
      ```

       ![](./media/dce37743ff7c0ac432568759948e5824.png)

      
      > Note: It must be set before the BCF program is officially launched (referring to start by double-clicking the icon of the application program BCF.exe), and the password will be invalid after startup.

#### Other information

1. The user has not set a password
   
   If the user does not set a password, the command to query the current latest block information is directly executed in the command line window
   
   ```

   bcf /glb

   ```
   You can also get the latest block information:
   
    ![](./media/86763529166c267204a36663d1729990.png)


2. The user has set a password
   
   If the user has a password, directly use the command `bcf /glb` to make an error, as shown in the following figure:
   
    ![](./media/636c679f0317dfec969f51c0f9aa26d2.png)

   
    If you want to call it correctly, you need to add the password `/sp 123` after each command line
    
    ```
    bcf /glb /sp 123

    ```
    The command execution result is as follows:
    ![](./media/b19069ef27abf80b4e4bb10b9629cbab.png)


3. The user forgot the password
   
   If the user forgets the password, he cannot use the command line command to access the interface. In this case, the user can only close the program first and reset the password when restarting.

### Configure the network environment

BCF provides a test network and a formal network environment for users to use, and the default is the test network environment. Users can freely switch the operating environment of BCF according to actual needs.


Follow the steps below to switch between the official network and the test network:

1. Modify the configuration file, the configuration file path: `/installation directory/conf/base-config.json`:
   
   1. Set the parameters of `bnid` (blockchain network type identifier):
      
      1. If you want to run in a test network environment, set `bnid` to `c`
      
      2. If you want to run in a formal network environment, set `bnid` to `b`
      
      ![](./media/910931246dae3f71cf6807aeb34107f0.png)


> Note: In the subsequent use process, if the user needs to switch the node network status, it is best to close the BCF node program and restart it after the configuration is complete; otherwise, if the configuration file is modified during the BCF operation, the current configuration file can be saved. Success, but the configuration will not take effect. Only after restarting the modified configuration can it take effect.

### Configure the chain that the node runs on

BCF runs the BFMeta chain by default, and it also supports switching between different chains. Users can freely switch the chain of current BCF node operation according to actual needs. This step is suitable for users who want to run the genesis block applied for by themselves or the genesis block obtained from outside.

Follow the steps below to switch between different chains:

1. Modify the configuration file, the configuration file path: `/installation directory/conf/base-config.json`:
   
   1. Set the `isGenesisBlockProvidedExternally` parameter:
      
      1. If you want to run your own or external chain, set `isGenesisBlockProvidedExternally` to `true`; at the same time, you need to modify the following parameter values ​​`chainName`, `assetType` and `chainMagic`;
      
      2. If you want to run the BFMeta main chain, set `isGenesisBlockProvidedExternally` to `false`
      
      ![](./media/c5ba8d37739c1a74bf5c1d62e777ee22.png)


The description of each parameter is as follows:

| **Parameter name** | **Parameter description** | **Parameter content description**                                    |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `isGenesisBlockProvidedExternally` | Whether to start with your own genesis block | `true`: means to start the node with the specified genesis block `false`: means to start the node with BFMeta |
| `bnid` | Blockchain network type identifier | `c`: means to start in test network mode `b`: means to start in official network mode |
| `chainName` | The name of the blockchain to be launched | It needs to be the same as the name of the blockchain to be launched |
| `chainAssetType` | The name of the main equity of the blockchain to be activated | It needs to be the same as the name of the main equity of the activated blockchain |
| `chainMagic` | Identifier of the blockchain network to be activated | It needs to be the same as the identifier of the blockchain network to be activated                              |



## Start the BCF node program

### Start the BCF node program

After the user completes the relevant configuration in the above chapters, just double-click the icon of the BCF node program to start the BCF node program.

When the interface shown in the figure below appears, it means that the BCF node has been started successfully:


![](./media/3cdf6ae49af24c45d4b63a09b9e5e0b9.png)


After successfully launching the interface, the current chain information will be displayed, and the explanation of each parameter is as follows:

| **Parameters** | **Parameter meaning**                                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Node Version`          | The version number of the current node |
| `Chain Name` | The chain name of the current node |
| `Magic` | The network identifier of the current node |
| `Status` | Current node status |
| `Net Version` | Current network environment `testnet`: test network `mainnet`: official network |
| `Mongo Version` | Database version |
| `Number Of Local Nodes` | Number of local nodes |
| `Lastblock height` | Current node height |
| `MAX_PEER_NUM` | Maximum number of connected nodes |
| `MAX_TPS` | Maximum allowed peak value |
| `TRANSACTION_RANGE` | Function range |
| `LICENSE_LEFT` | Authorization remaining height (when the block has reached the authorization height, the block will not be forged, you need to contact the bcf team to update the authorization file to continue forging) |
| `FORGE_INTERVAL` | Blocking interval, refers to the interval time of each block |
| `BLOCK_PERROUND` | The number of blocks per round |
| `FORGE_REWARDPERCENT` | The proportion of forging block revenue. For example, if the total block reward is 35 and the ratio is 0.3, the forger will get a reward of 10.5 |
| `VOTE_REWARDPERCENT` | Participate in voting to get the proportion of revenue. For example, if the total block reward is 35 and the ratio is 0.7, the total reward that can be distributed by the voting addresses is 24.5 |
| `INITIAL_REWARD` | Block initial reward value                                           |

## Node identity binding

When the user successfully starts the BCF, the interface will give the prompt "Waiting for binding address" as shown in the figure below:

![](./media/21f44b3a2fd77af749a3b02bc750c2bb.png)


At this point, you need to bind an identity (address) to your node so that your node can connect to the blockchain network for block synchronization and participate in on-chain governance.

You can complete the node identity binding in the following two ways:

- Send commands through the command line window to complete identity binding

1. Start BCF;
2. Open the Windows command window;
3. Enter the following command in the command window:

```
bcf /ba systemSecret="Your node password", delegateSecret="The master password of the identity you plan to bind"
```

> Note: In the above command, the content of double quotes needs to be replaced with the corresponding content

   
4. When the node program-BCF interface gives the bound identity (address) information, it means that the node's identity (address) is successfully bound, as shown in the following figure:
![](./media/7d0826ca4a0b6e94cf29ffddbeda0349.png)


- Complete identity binding through node manager

1. Log in to the BFMeta mobile app
2. Enter the node manager
3. Enter the node IP
4. Enter the node password
5. Bind the identity and security password to the node (if the identity has a security password)
![](./media/bindingaddress2.png)


When the node completes the above identity binding, it means that your node is connected to the BFMeta blockchain network and can directly participate in on-chain governance and block synchronization.


> Note 1: For the use of the `ba` interface and its parameters, please refer to [\<Bind node account\>](/en/API_reference/PC_full_node/Interface_list/1-4#9-bind-node-account);

> Note 2: As the text editing and other operations in the Windows console will temporarily stop the program, if there is no response on the BCF interface when executing the command in step 3, you can press `Enter` and the BCF will continue to run.

## Node status

After the user successfully binds the address, the BCF interface will display the status information of the current node. The following describes several common node statuses.

### Node forging block

The information shown in the following figure indicates that the node is continuously forging new blocks, and prints out related log information during the block forging process, such as block height, block timestamp, number of events included, etc.:

### Node synchronization block

The following figure shows the console log information when synchronizing blocks, indicating that the node is synchronizing blocks to other nodes normally at this time:

### Node reconstruction

The following figure shows the reconstruction of the database, which is usually triggered at the first startup, or when the node is forked and there are no critical checkpoints. At this time, it means that the node is reconstructing the blockchain data, which is a link in the normal startup process:
